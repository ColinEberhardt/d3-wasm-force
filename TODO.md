[x] Create multiple typescript configurations
[ ] Use the ASC compiler directly to inline the code (note, could use rollup-plugin-wasm), although inline code is still async
[x] Resolve build-wasm warnings
[ ] Find a better way to read / write WASM buffers
[ ] Make use of d3-force typing
[ ] ensure the code behaves exactly the same as d3-force

Being able to debug the typescript before wasm assembly is fantastic! e.g. NRE when accessing links[23]
